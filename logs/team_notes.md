# **Week 1**
- **Lucy**  
  - Shared graphs and explained the data.  

- **Waseem**  
  - Presented cosine similarity findings.  
  - Can use Lucy's song data for the next phase.  

- **Jakub**  
  - Shared research on how he will use user listening data.  

- **Next Steps**  
  - Lucy does not have user listening data but will find and clean it for Jakub.  
  - Make genre data quantitative to allow for similarity comparisons.  
  - Adjust the timeline so that in **Week 3 and 4**, both Jakub and Waseem work on coding their respective models.  
  - Lucy will conduct research on potential improvements and additional features.  
  - Implement extra meetings to ensure algorithm compatibility and maintain accountability.  
  - **Week 4:** Lucy continues research and suggests improvements.  
  - **Week 5:**  
    - Lucy starts on the user interface and web app.  
    - Jakub and Waseem (with Lucy's help) integrate both algorithms and begin testing.  
  - **Week 6:**  
    - Combine the algorithms with the web app (or API); Lucy and Jakub will handle this.  
    - Waseem will work on writing documentation.

# **Week 2**
- **Lucy**  
  - Created bins for each feature.  
  - Developed genre clusters, grouping similar genres together.  
  - Realized genre names were not saved, but this does not affect the process.  

- **Jakub**  
  - Imported user data and attempted to convert it into a database.  
  - The database is too large and sparse, making it impractical for **Pandas SQL**.  
  - Will explore alternative tools such as **DB Browser** or other software for large-scale data handling.  
  - May need to reduce the dataset size.  

- **Waseem**  
  - Working on structuring songs into a **relational database**.  
  - Identified that not all data is useful and will separate it into:  
    - A table for **data processing**.  
    - A table for the **future website**.  
  - Considering **Column Q** as the **primary key** for the data processing table.  

- **Next Steps**  
  - **Weeks 3 and 4** will be merged into a single phase.  
  - Both Jakub and Waseem will start developing their respective models.  
  - By the next meeting, a **very basic model** should be completed.  
  - Everyone will review the code to ensure alignment.  
  - Ensure that both models can be combined in the future.  
  - Lucy will research how to integrate the algorithm into a website and start planning the web development phase.
