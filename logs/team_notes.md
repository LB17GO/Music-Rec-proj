## Week 1
*Lucy shared graphs and talked them through the data\
*Wassem shared cosine similarity findings, can use Lucy's song data to work on next part\
*Jakub shared research on how he will use user listening data\
*Next steps\
  *Lucy does not have user listening data, but will find user listening data for Jakub and clean it and stuff so Jakub can use it\
  *Genre quantitive, make it so we can compare similar genres\
  *Change it so week 3 and 4 both Jakub and Waseem are coding their respective models\
  *Lucy will be doing some research on how to improve, extra features adding\
  *Implement extra meetings to go over compatibility of algorithms and keep them accountable\
  *Lucy week 4 research and suggesting improvements\
  *Lucy week 5 start on user interface and web app\
  *Week 5 Waseem and Jakub (with Lucy's help) put two algorithms together and test it\
  *Week 6 combine algorithms with web app (or API), Lucy and Jakub do this\
  *Week 6 Waseem doing tipy tappy write up\

## Week 2
*Lucy\
  *Made bins for each of the features\
  *Created genre clusters, where each cluster represents a group of similar genres\
  *Realsied didnâ€™t save names of genres, but does not matter\
*Jakub\
  *Took user data, tried to turn it into a database
  *Database very large and sparse, too big for pandas SQL
  *Jakub going to try db browser or other software
  *Might need to reduce dataset 
*Waseem
  *Trying to put songs into a relational database, but not all data useful
  *Going to seperate into a table for data processing and a table for the future website
  *Primary key could be Q
*Next Steps
  *We're going to combine weeks 3 and 4
  *Both Jakub and Waseem will start on their respective models
  *By next meeting, have a very basic model
  *We'll all review the code 
  *Make sure that both models can be combined in the future
  *Lucy wil research how to combine the algorithm with a website and start planning website
